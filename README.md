Adds new configurations for RCS intakes! Starts off with a simple in-line intake, functionally identical to the Kang RCS Intake.
Long-term plans include having configurations that're more compact than the Kang, but less effective than the Hydra.
A potential branch might be made to modify weight and height of the various intakes so that more spread-out intakes are lighter or shorter or with various power requirements, allowing for a variety of potential builds and use-cases.

Updates:
 - V .11:
    - Adds a new intake, the DoubleDutch; almost identical in design to the Kang, save with two ports instead of one.
 - V .12:
    - Adds the Intake Kiosk to...Well, existence anyway. Still not actually in OKLG proper. Still, you can spawn it if you want! Or add it to the game via the map editor and a new game! Otherwise, I'm still trying to work out a way to ensure compatibility with other mods while adding vendors.
 - V .13
    - Adds THREE new intakes: The Inverse, a simple Kang except the intake port is on the left by default. The Branch, a simple T configuration Kang. And the Varmint, which is a quad-port Kang. While the fluff talks about it being lighter, this is not the version where I mess with intake weights.
 - V .14
    - Adds FOUR new intakes: The Chancellor, a 3-port varient of the Hydra. The Derrick, a 2-port varient of the Hydra. The Compact...Can you guess it? That's right! A 1-port varient of the Hydra. And finally, the InHouse, a completely original and ugly as sin 1-port floor-based RCS intake! That's right, this is the first actually *new* concept added with this Mod!
    - On that note, there's two last intakes to add and then the trader kiosk will be updated and hopefully turned into a merchant available at K-Leg. Maybe. We'll see. Either way, things are more likely to be unstable, so this is probably the version you want to stop on for stability.
 - V .15
    - The final two intakes are added: The 2242, an internal intake based on the Kang 2202. The Asura, an internal intake based on the Miura Hydra. Both intakes have an inventory space where you can insert N2 canisters to fill the internal reservoir, which is directly used as RCS. In a stark reversal, the 2242 has more internal storage than the Asura(for now), resulting in the 2242 being the superior model; it can hold two canisters of N2! And once I figure out how to more precisely set the triggers, perhaps a third for topping it up.
 - V .15.2
    - A critical error preventing the intakes from being installed has been fixed; all intake jsons have been unified which drops the footprint of the mod overall; recolors have been applied to the majority of intakes to provide visual distinction; monetary values have been assigned based off of the base design and how many slots the intake has, with internal intakes being the most expensive due to their inherent ridiculousness.
