Adds new configurations for RCS intakes! Starts off with a simple in-line intake, functionally identical to the Kang RCS Intake.
Long-term plans include having configurations that're more compact than the Kang, but less effective than the Hydra.
A potential branch might be made to modify weight and height of the various intakes so that more spread-out intakes are lighter or shorter or with various power requirements, allowing for a variety of potential builds and use-cases.

Updates:
 - V .11:
    - Adds a new intake, the DoubleDutch; almost identical in design to the Kang, save with two ports instead of one.
 - V .12:
    - Adds the Intake Kiosk to...Well, existence anyway. Still not actually in OKLG proper. Still, you can spawn it if you want! Or add it to the game via the map editor and a new game! Otherwise, I'm still trying to work out a way to ensure compatibility with other mods while adding vendors.
 - V .13
    - Adds THREE new intakes: The Inverse, a simple Kang except the intake port is on the left by default. The Branch, a simple T configuration Kang. And the Varmint, which is a quad-port Kang. While the fluff talks about it being lighter, this is not the version where I mess with intake weights.
 - V .14
    - Adds FOUR new intakes: The Chancellor, a 3-port varient of the Hydra. The Derrick, a 2-port varient of the Hydra. The Compact...Can you guess it? That's right! A 1-port varient of the Hydra. And finally, the InHouse, a completely original and ugly as sin 1-port floor-based RCS intake! That's right, this is the first actually *new* concept added with this Mod!
    - On that note, there's two last intakes to add and then the trader kiosk will be updated and hopefully turned into a merchant available at K-Leg. Maybe. We'll see. Either way, things are more likely to be unstable, so this is probably the version you want to stop on for stability.
