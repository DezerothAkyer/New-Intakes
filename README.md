Adds new configurations for RCS intakes! Starts off with a simple in-line intake, functionally identical to the Kang RCS Intake.
There is a major offset issue with the component, but functionally it works fine. It'll take power, you can stick the canister where the input port indicates, it'll work.
Long-term plans include having configurations that're more compact than the Kang, but less effective than the Hydra.
A potential branch might be made to modify weight and height of the various intakes so that more spread-out intakes are lighter or shorter or with various power requirements, allowing for a variety of potential builds and use-cases.
